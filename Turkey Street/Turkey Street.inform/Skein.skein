Welcome to Turkey Street! You are about to embark upon a gritty and super serious parser adventure where you play as a turkey detective. Before you start, please be aware that some of the commands may be different from other games that you have played in the past. Examine all of the evidence to solve the case!

Commands are limited to directional travel (N, S, E, W), LOOK, EXAMINE (or X), GIVE, TAKE, DROP, WAIT, EAT, DRINK, and GOBBLE or GOBBLE AT (which refers to turkey speak, not the action of eating). You can also type COMMANDS to see this list again, UNDO to go back a turn, or SAVE to record your progress. Have fun!

An Interactive Fiction by Raymond Vermeulen and Matthew Deline

The Roost
Back at the roost, there's two wild turkeys. One's a bottle and it's perfectly aged, one's a P.I. and it's aged perfectly. The name's Fowl Feathers. Uncompromising since 2015. In my line of work, you meet a lot of birds. And the birds always like a bad egg. 

The roost smells faintly of sawdust, old eggs, and bourbon. The half-drunk bottle explains the half-drunk turkey. A chick is pacing back and forth, occasionally stopping to peck at itself.

You can see a sign here.

The chick's distress is still fresh and palpable. She can't help me now. I leave her to her clucking. With some luck, she'll still be there when I come home to roost. I spread my wings and glide away to the next case. A case more interesting than the typical cuckolding of henpecked husbands I get saddled with. The case of... WHY THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD.

A bang. A yelp. A corpse. A chicken with a chalk outline, leaving behind a ghost with nobody to haunt.  The pancaked poultry beckons from within the cordon. I'll have to do the haunting for it. 

A very dead chicken lies in the center of the road

You can also see a fox and an eagle here.

All roads lead back to the scene of the crime. Futility, or just fatality? There's a metaphor here, if one cares to explore it. And also a station entrance.

A cardinal direction. A cardinal sin. My corpse has taken another spin on the karmic wheel, helped along by some mundane ones. There's no justice on these streets. There's just us. 

You can see a bus stop (on which is a red herring), a heron and a duck here.

The West End is known for two things. Good plays, and bad turns. Which explains the unfolding supermarket turf war. The cordon of turkeys is a recent addition.

On the Case
The chick's distress is still fresh and palpable. She can't help me now. I leave her to her clucking. With some luck, she'll still be there when I come home to roost. I spread my wings and glide away to the next case. A case more interesting than the typical cuckolding of henpecked husbands I get saddled with. The case of... WHY THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD. 

This road continues north ... to Turkey Street.

Turkey Street Station
A bang. A yelp. A corpse. A chicken with a chalk outline, leaving behind a ghost with nobody to haunt.  The pancaked poultry beckons from within the cordon. I'll have to do the haunting for it. 

All roads lead back to the scene of the crime. Futility, or just fatality? There's a metaphor here, if one cares to explore it. And also a station entrance. A lonely lamppost stands across the street, like a lighthouse for a shipwrecked life.

A very dead chicken lies in the center of the road

Crows. Scavengers, the murderous lot of them. I'd watch my belongings around them, if I could carry any.

Glorious, majestic, and free in all the ways that I am not. I already hate this bird. The feeling is probably mutual.

Turkey Street East
People have always looked to the East for their panaceas. But Turkey Street is sick, rotten to the core. I can't cure what ails it--I can only burn it out. 

There's an edge to the air in East End, an edge I live on. And so does an ornithophobic child cowering in fear from the spectre of a gluttonous duck feasting on bits of bread strewn everywhere. For now, a cordon of turkeys joins me on the edge.

You can see a child and a duck here.

All roads lead back to the scene of the crime. Futility, or just fatality? There's a metaphor here, if one cares to explore it. And also a station entrance. A lonely lamppost stands across the street near a Nando's, like a lighthouse for a shipwrecked life.

You can see a nothing (examined), a dead chicken, a cardboard box with a hole in it, a crow and an Eagle here.

Turkey Street West
A cardinal direction. A cardinal sin. My corpse has taken another spin on the karmic wheel, helped along by some mundane ones. There's no justice on these streets. There's just us. 

The West End is known for two things. Good plays, and bad turns. Which explains the unfolding supermarket turf war. The cordon of turkeys is a recent addition.

Herons like to feast on small prey. This one has a lean, hungry look to it. It knows something.

A winged killer, a seductive bird of prey. Once its yellow eye falls on you, it's already too late. Did it fall on the chicken?

You can also see a bus stop and a garbage bin here.

Turkey Street East
People have always looked to the East for their panaceas. But Turkey Street is sick, rotten to the core. I can't cure what ails it--I can only burn it out. 

There's an edge to the air in East End, an edge I live on. And so do OBJECT and OBJECT2. For now, a cordon of turkeys joins me on the edge.

Dark of wing and dull of bill. The duck stands in a field, and wears no pants. It appears hungry. Hungry for the truth? Or for more murder?

There's an edge to the air in East End, an edge I live on. And so do OBJECT and OBJECT2. For now, a cordon of turkeys joins me on the edge.

Dark of wing and dull of bill. The duck stands in a field, and wears no pants. It appears hungry. Hungry for the truth? Or for more murder?

Turkey Street West
A cardinal direction. A cardinal sin. My corpse has taken another spin on the karmic wheel, helped along by some mundane ones. There's no justice on these streets. There's just us. 

The West End is known for two things. Good plays, and bad turns. Which explains the unfolding supermarket turf war. The cordon of turkeys is a recent addition.

Herons like to feast on small prey. This one has a lean, hungry look to it. It knows something.

A winged killer, a seductive bird of prey. Once its yellow eye falls on you, it's already too late. Did it fall on the chicken?

You can also see a bus stop and a garbage bin here.

You stare down the crow. It stares back at you. Time slows down. Eternity passes. "Gobble. GOBBLE."

Turkey Street East
People have always looked to the East for their panaceas. But Turkey Street is sick, rotten to the core. I can't cure what ails it--I can only burn it out. 

There's an edge to the air in East End, an edge I live on. And so does an ornithophobic child cowering in fear from the spectre of a gluttonous duck feasting on bits of bread strewn everywhere. For now, a cordon of turkeys joins me on the edge.

You can see a child and a duck here.

Turkey Street West
A cardinal direction. A cardinal sin. My corpse has taken another spin on the karmic wheel, helped along by some mundane ones. There's no justice on these streets. There's just us. 

The West End is known for two things. Good plays, and bad turns. Which explains the unfolding supermarket turf war. The cordon of turkeys is a recent addition.

Herons like to feast on small prey. This one has a lean, hungry look to it. It knows something.

A winged killer, a seductive bird of prey. Once its yellow eye falls on you, it's already too late. Did it fall on the chicken?

You can also see a bus stop and a garbage bin here.

Turkey Street East
People have always looked to the East for their panaceas. But Turkey Street is sick, rotten to the core. I can't cure what ails it--I can only burn it out. 

There's an edge to the air in East End, an edge I live on.  And so does an ornithophobic child cowering in fear from the spectre of a gluttonous duck feasting on bread strewn everywhere. For now, a cordon of turkeys joins me on the edge to the east.

You can see some bread, a child and a duck here.

Death swoops in from above and in a flash of beak and squeak, the mouse is gone. The eagle returns to his perch, leaving the shiny ring on the ground.

In my line of work, you meet a lot of birds. And the birds always like a bad egg. But the bad eggs... don't always like the birds. 

 The rose, the picture, the locket, the book, the ring... they tell a story of a chicken consumed with love. But the letter... the letter tells the story of a forbidden love. Love that cannot, should not be. 

 It wasn't the car that killed the chicken. It wasn't the tire pressing down on the spine, it wasn't the sudden egress of organs. It was the simplest thing in the world. 

 The chicken was killed with love. Love drove it out into the street, love drove it out to find an ending. 

 Why did the chicken cross Turkey Street? Why did the chicken cross the road? We all know this one. The chicken crossed the road... to get to the other side.

On the Case
The chick's distress is still fresh and palpable. She can't help me now. I leave her to her clucking. With some luck, she'll still be there when I come home to roost. I spread my wings and glide away to the next case. A case more interesting than the typical cuckolding of henpecked husbands I get saddled with. The case of... WHY THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD.

Turkey Street Station
A bang. A yelp. A corpse. A chicken with a chalk outline, leaving behind a ghost with nobody to haunt.  The pancaked poultry beckons from within the cordon. I'll have to do the haunting for it. 

All roads lead back to the scene of the crime. Futility, or just fatality? There's a metaphor here, if one cares to explore it. And also a station entrance. A lonely lamppost stands across the street, like a lighthouse for a shipwrecked life.

A very dead chicken lies in the center of the road

Crows. Scavengers, the murderous lot of them. I'd watch my belongings around them, if I could carry any.

Glorious, majestic, and free in all the ways that I am not. I already hate this bird. The feeling is probably mutual.

Turkey Street West
A cardinal direction. A cardinal sin. My corpse has taken another spin on the karmic wheel, helped along by some mundane ones. There's no justice on these streets. There's just us. 

The West End is known for two things. Good plays, and bad turns. Which explains the unfolding supermarket turf war. The cordon of turkeys is a recent addition.

Herons like to feast on small prey. This one has a lean, hungry look to it. It knows something.

A winged killer, a seductive bird of prey. Once its yellow eye falls on you, it's already too late. Did it fall on the chicken?

You can also see a bus stop and a garbage bin here.

        <result xml:space="preserve">In my line of work, you meet a lot of birds. And the birds always like a bad egg. But the bad eggs... don't always like the birds. 

 The rose, the picture, the locket, the book, the ring... they tell a story of a chicken consumed with love. But the letter... the letter tells the story of a forbidden love. Love that cannot, should not be. 

 It wasn't the car that killed the chicken. It wasn't the tire pressing down on the spine, it wasn't the sudden egress of organs. It was the simplest thing in the world. 

 The chicken was killed with love. Love drove it out into the street, love drove it out to find an ending. 

 Why did the chicken cross Turkey Street? Why did the chicken cross the road? We all know this one. The chicken crossed the road... to get to the other side. 


    *** The End ***


In that game you scored 1000 out of a possible 70, in 1 turn.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?

        <result xml:space="preserve">Turkey Street
An Interactive Fiction by Raymond Vermeulen and Matthew Deline
Release 1 / Serial number 180502 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

The Roost
Back at the roost, there's two wild turkeys. One's a bottle and it's perfectly aged, one's a P.I. and it's aged perfectly. The name's Fowl Feathers. Uncompromising since 2015. In my line of work, you meet a lot of birds. And the birds always like a bad egg. 

The roost smells faintly of sawdust, old eggs, and bourbon. The half-drunk bottle explains the half-drunk turkey. A chick is pacing back and forth, occasionally stopping to peck at itself.

You can see a sign here.

The chick's distress is still fresh and palpable. She can't help me now. I leave her to her clucking. With some luck, she'll still be there when I come home to roost. I spread my wings and glide away to the next case. A case more interesting than the typical cuckolding of henpecked husbands I get saddled with. The case of... WHY THE CHICKEN CROSSED THE ROAD.

Welcome to Turkey Street! You are about to embark upon a gritty and super serious parser adventure where you play as a turkey detective. Before you start, please be aware that some of the commands may be different from other games that you have played in the past.

Commands are limited to directional travel (N, S, E, W), LOOK, EXAMINE (or X), GIVE, TAKE, DROP, WAIT, EAT, DRINK, and GOBBLE or GOBBLE AT (which refers to turkey speak, not the action of eating). You can also type COMMANDS to see this list again, UNDO to go back a turn, or SAVE to record your progress. Have fun!


   Start the story - from the beginning    :    (SPACE)
                   - from a saved position :       R
   Quit                                    :       Q</result>
