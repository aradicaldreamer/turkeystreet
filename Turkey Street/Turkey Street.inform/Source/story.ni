Book 1 - To Do List

[

	- Replace Talk to with Gobble
	
	- Find a way to track seen evidence, so that when all the evidence is seen, the game ends (this way we donâ€™t have to worry about the player needing to collect evidence)
	
	- Limit inventory to one item at a time
	
	- Write place descriptions for each location
	
	- Add interactive items to each location
	
	- Add evidence to each location
	
	- Add NPCs to each location
	
	- Add behavior to the NPCs
	
	- Add dialogue with scenes?

Book 2 - Notes

[

	- Please do not read this until AFTER you have played the game (SPOILERS)
	
	- Two cases, thematically similar that share the same general locations and actions.
	
	- Main protagonists: Turkey detective and his duck/human friend
	
	- limits playable space, because Turkeys can't open doors!
	
	- Turkey Name: Detective Fowl Feathers, Poultry Investigator
	
	- NPCs, Fox, Duck, Child, Heron, Eagle, Chicken, Turkeys, Owl
	
	- Who did it? OWL.
	
	- Turkeys create a barrier to block the the exits to turkey street east and west (stopping cars from coming through)
	
	- Find a way to collect evidence into inventory without removing from the scene (maybe we can do this by making a check to see if the player has SEEN all the evidence?
	
	- Gobble can replace talking to?
	
	- Limit inventory to one item at a time?

[Introduction text inspired by the opening text in The Wizard Sniffer by Buster Hudson]

To say quotation:
	say "Welcome to Turkey Street! You are about to embark upon a gritty and super serious parser adventure where you play as a turkey detective. Before you start, please be aware that some of the commands may be different from other games that you have played in the past.
	
	Commands are limited to directional travel (N, S, E, W), LOOK, EXAMINE (or X), TAKE, DROP, WAIT, and GOBBLE or GOBBLE AT (which refers to turkey speak, not the action of eating). If you are unfamiliar with parser based games, you can type HELP or COMMANDS to get a full list, and SAVE to save your progress. Have fun!".

The introduction of The Roost is "Back at the roost, there's two wild turkeys. One's a bottle and it's perfectly aged, one's a P.I. and it's aged perfectly. The name's Fowl Feathers. Uncompromising since 2015. In my line of work, you meet a lot of birds. And the birds always like a bad egg."
